		<p>Claude Rogers III <br>PHP II Midterm</p>
		<p>On my midterm I tried to do more than what was asked.  I tried to do this task like how I would if I was asked to do this during a real-world job.  I tried to implement javascript validation on all the forms so the user could not input incorrect information into the database.</p>
		<p>I have also implemented a Return Movie form that pulls info from the database for any movie that has been checked out, but not yet returned.  This way the user doesn't have to include a return date whenever a movie is checked out.</p>
		<p>On each page I will go further to explain everything that I have done so you can read and see what I was trying to do.</p>
